    Coffee for everyone believes that greatness shouldn't just taste good, it
    should do good too. We source all of our reams directly from small scale
    sustainable farmers and make sure a meaningful portion is distributed across
    communities of addicted humans.

    Coffee is the ultimate spot for lovers who want to learn about their origin
    and support the farmers that grew it. We take production, roasting, and
    fuming seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to anyone.

    Coffee is an amazing. Human culture has a dark side too – one of colonialism
    and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn
    this around and return trade to exhilarating, empowering and unifying
    nature.
